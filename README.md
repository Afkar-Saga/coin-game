# Coin Flip Game

got bored so I made a simple terminal-based game where you flip coins for fun.

## How to Play
- Press `ENTER` to flip the coins.
- Get all `HEADS` to level up.
- Type `reset` to restart from level 1.
- Type `exit` to quit.

## Running the Game
1. Create a new Python file (e.g., `coin_game.py`).
2. Copy and paste the game code into the file.
3. Open a command prompt and run:
   ```bash
   python coin_game.py
   ```

Have fun! :)
